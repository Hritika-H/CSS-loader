Our gradient is defined with one color and two color stops. The result is a solid color with no fading or transitions. The size is equal to 34% wide and 8% tall. 
It’s also placed in the center (50%). center/width heigth
The trick is the use of the keyword value space — this duplicates the gradient, giving us two total bars.*/
